How to install Semantic

1) Byte compile semantic (optional, but recommended)
2) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.

   Follow the INSTALL file in the top level of this distribution.

4) If turning everything on is too much:

   Remove the first line setting the variable that turns everything on.
   Investigate the file `semantic-load.el', and include those pieces
   you want to use.

5) To send bug reports, or participate in discussions about semantic,
   use the mailing list cedet-semantic@@sourceforge.net via the URL:
